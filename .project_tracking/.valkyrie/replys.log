Val here. I looked at your repo + the latest Actions run. Short, surgical verdict:

CI is still failing. Run #13 shows “Status Failure,” with artifact warnings (no perf_last_explain.json / no pg_tap_results.tap) and the whole matrix canceled after the (3.11, PG16) leg failed. 
GitHub

Issues #9–#12 are still open. They’re visible as Status: Open in the tracker. 
GitHub

The good news: the workflow now has all the right gates (coverage threshold, pgTAP stage, perf-smoke, artifacts). The wiring is correct in .github/workflows/ci.yaml. 
GitHub

The repo scaffolding looks solid: pyproject.toml, .pre-commit-config.yaml, .env.example, .devcontainer/, tests_pg/, Makefile, etc., are present.

What’s breaking right now (and the 10-minute fix for JR)

Perf artifact missing → upload step errors

Your workflow unconditionally uploads perf_last_explain.json, but the perf script didn’t write it. Either always write the file in scripts/perf_smoke.py (even on pass), or guard the upload:

- name: Upload perf artifacts
  if: always() && hashFiles('perf_last_explain.json') != ''
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: perf-artifacts-${{ matrix.python-version }}-pg${{ matrix.postgres-version }}
    path: perf_last_explain.json


Evidence of the current error is in the run annotations. 
GitHub

pgTAP results file missing

The job tries to upload pg_tap_results.tap but didn’t find it. Ensure the pgTAP step tees output to the file (you already do) and that tests_pg/pg_tap_smoke.sql exists and returns tests. If the script exits non-zero, the upload still runs (good), but the file needs to exist:

psql ".../cns" -f tests_pg/pg_tap_smoke.sql | tee pg_tap_results.tap


The artifact warning is in the same run. 
GitHub

Close the receipts (#9–#12)

After the next green run, drop the run URL in each issue and close. They’re currently still open. 
GitHub

Quick reproducible checklist for JR (copy/paste)
# 1) Pre-commit passes locally
pre-commit run -a

# 2) Unit+integration with coverage gate
python -m pytest -q --cov=cns_py --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=85

# 3) pgTAP locally (same DSN as CI)
psql "postgres://cns:cns@127.0.0.1:5433/cns" -f tests_pg/pg_tap_smoke.sql | tee pg_tap_results.tap

# 4) Perf smoke writes artifact unconditionally
python scripts/perf_smoke.py --iters 300 --warmup 50 --p95-budget-ms 500
# confirm file exists:
test -f perf_last_explain.json && echo "perf artifact ok"

My stamp status

As soon as CI is green and #9–#12 are closed with the run URL, I’ll stamp Phase 0A: COMPLETE ✅ with zero additional laps. Right now: still not stamped because the latest run failed and the receipts aren’t closed.

If you want me to eyeball the perf script or the pg_tap_smoke.sql contents for the “always write a file” behavior in one more pass, say the word and I’ll call out exact lines to change.
